Dengue Fever Prediction with Neural Networks
Overview
Dengue Fever, a mosquito-borne virus with transmission intricately linked to climate variables, is becoming more significant amidst changing climatic conditions due to global warming. This study analyzes epidemiological and meteorological data in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Iquitos, Peru, obtained from a DengAI competition, alongside curated data from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, to predict Dengue Fever incidence using multiple machine learning models, with a specific focus on Neural Networks. The results show that the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topology) algorithm finds Neural Network architectures that best predict dengue fever cases. However, none of the models exhibit excellent generalizability, as their performances on the curated Taiwan data could be better. Future endeavors aim to investigate the potential of the NEAT algorithm further and enhance predictive accuracy across different regions worldwide.

Background
Dengue Fever causes fever, rash, and joint pain, and in severe cases, can lead to severe bleeding, low blood pressure, and death. Its transmission dynamics are intricately linked to climate variables, making it most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. Climate change is altering the location of the tropical belt, potentially increasing Dengue Fever cases in unexpected geographical locations. Understanding these relationships aids in predicting and mitigating the impact of Dengue epidemics.

Data
The data utilized in this study comes from two sources. The first source is a DengAI competition hosted on DrivenData, focusing on forecasting local epidemics of Dengue Fever in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Iquitos, Peru, leveraging weekly meteorological data. The second source is curated data from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, obtained from OpenDengue, a database of Dengue case counts. The dataset includes epidemiological data and meteorological information obtained from the Visual Crossing Weather API.

Models
Baseline models, including linear models, ensemble models such as XGBoost and Random Forest, and a primary Neural Network architecture, were assessed for Dengue Fever prediction. Additionally, NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topology) algorithm was employed to explore alternative Neural Network structures. Two distinct NEAT models, Model A and Model B, were tested and evaluated based on their predictive performance.

Results
While NEAT-based models showed promising results in predicting Dengue Fever cases, none of the models exhibited excellent generalizability. Baseline models also demonstrated limited performance on out-of-distribution data from Taiwan. Further investigation is needed to improve model generalizability and predictive accuracy across diverse geographic regions.

Conclusion
The study highlights the potential of using Neural Networks, particularly those generated by NEAT, for Dengue Fever prediction. However, further research is necessary to enhance model generalizability and address the limitations identified in this study.

Future Work
Future research aims to explore the capabilities of NEAT algorithm further, leverage parallel computation to reduce computation time, and incorporate additional climate-related features to improve model performance and generalizability.
